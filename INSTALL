INSTALLATION
============

STANDARD LOCATIONS
------------------

To install this module in standard locations type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

On Unix systems you will typically need root privileges for the last step
that installs the module for all users on your machine.


USER DEFINED LOCATIONS
----------------------

If you want to install it to a location in your home directory you can alter
the first command in the following way (where 'uid' is your username):

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=/home/uid/lib/perl PREFIX=/home/uid/lib/perl

LIB is where the module files will go and PREFIX is the stub directory for
everything else.

Of course you have to tell perl that this user-specific directory should be
included into the module search path. Therefore you must set an environment
variable. Using bash as shell you would type:

  EXPORT PERLLIB=/home/uid/lib/perl


DE-INSTALLATION
===============

To uninstall this module return to the directory where you installed it from
and type:

  make uninstall
